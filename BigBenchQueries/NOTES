Query 11 not working, apparently the left semi join problem was solved but corr is not implemented
Query 14 was modified for Derby, the JOIN on 1 = 1 was eliminated, and the order by clause was added. Changed joins to agree with the paper specification.
Query 15 not working (LEFT SEMI JOIN)
Query 16 changed unix-timestamp calls to casts on DATE, as used by the paper, used timestamp for the arithmetic part plus the Derby function timestampadd
Query 17 removed apparently superflous JOIN between the main subqueries
Query 22 the datediff function is not available in Postgres, so the query uses age and EXTRACT epoch instead. IMPORTANT: two FETCH FIRST 100 ROWS ONLY
constructs are specified, one is possibly an error. IMPORTANT: 'problem column "inv_before" does not exist' in a HAVING clause for the Postgres version,
Derby version not implemented yet.
